I've been programming for a year, focusing on front-end development. I have made complex educational projects in Vanilla JS ([eCommerce](https://peakpulse-ecomm.netlify.app)) and React ([GraphiQL](https://rsschool-graphi-ql.netlify.app)). During the completion of my JS course at RS School, I took on the role of a team leader, where my leadership played a pivotal role in the successful completion of the final project.

Bringing more than 15 years of expertise in both manual and automated web testing, I possess a robust understanding of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), encompassing methodologies such as Agile (Scrum/Kanban) and Waterfall.
I have undertaken various roles throughout my career, including positions as a tester, Scrum Master, QA team lead, and overall team lead.
I am responsible, manage my work well, and learn quickly.
